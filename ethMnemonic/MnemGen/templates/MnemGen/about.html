<h1>About</h1>
<p>Author: Daniel Mistrik</p>
<p>This project was inspired by the complexity of Ethereum addresses. The 42-character long hexadecimal is a combination
    of seemingly random numbers and letter making them incredibly difficult to transfer through word of mouth.
    Misspelling or forgetting a single character can mean a non-reversible loss of ether. While improvements,
    such as <a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a> have improved memorability and error-checking they are not
    automatic to every address and often require payment to work. In short, the standard Ethereum address system is,
    for cryptographic reasons, a large and complicated one that is not intuitive and difficult to use and share
    in-person.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://what3words.com/">what3words</a> which turned the similarly complicated system of coordinates
    and location on Earth into three simple words this project converts every ethereum address into a unique mnemonic.
    Every ethereum address is assigned a unique 14-word mnemonic that one can share and use for error-checking. The
    mnemonic is composed of non-similar words so a change of even one character in the address should make a noticeably
    different mnemonic.The mnemonic is unique to every address is permanent.  One might ask why this mnemonic is 14 words
    and what3words just 3! The simple answer is that for security reasons the number of possible ethereum addresses is
    far greater than the number of places on Earth so this mnemonic needs to be larger. </p>
